Mogrify overwrites the original image file, whereas,\r\n       convert(1) writes to a different image file.\r\n  * `montage` create  a  composite image by combining several separate images. The images are tiled on the composite image optionally adorned with a border, frame,\r\n       image name, and more.\r\n  * `stream` a lightweight tool to stream one or more pixel components of the image or portion of the image to your choice of storage formats.\r\n* Poppler\r\n  * `pdfdetach` Portable Document Format (PDF) document embedded file extractor\r\n  * `pdffonts` Portable Document Format (PDF) font analyzer\r\n  * `pdfimages` Portable Document Format (PDF) image extractor\r\n  * `pdfinfo` Portable Document Format (PDF) document information extractor\r\n  * `pdfseparate` Portable Document Format (PDF) page extractor\r\n  * `pdftohtml` program to convert PDF files into HTML, XML and PNG images\r\n  * `pdftoppm` Portable Document Format (PDF) to Portable Pixmap (PPM) converter\r\n  * `pdftops` Portable Document Format (PDF) to PostScript converter\r\n  * `pdftotext` Portable Document Format (PDF) to text converter\r\n* File\r\n  * `file` determine file type\r\n* XZ Utils\r\n  * `xz` Compress or decompress .xz files\r\n  * `xzdec` Small .xz decompressor","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
